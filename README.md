# Pump-Failure-Prediction
A meta-analysis based on the attached regression workbook with the goal of pump failure prediction based on rolling mean values. The original workbook made several incorrect assumptions including basing regression analysis on rolling mean values create a regressive equation to predict pump failure. When using the raw values, however, it became clear that there was no such warning present for pump failure and the pump registered as failed the same minute that the raw values deviated from their normal range.
